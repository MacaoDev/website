        answer:
          <div className="answer">
            TCAP is for users that want to speculate in the total cryptocurrency market by buying a token that is the representation of the entire market.
            It’s also for DeFi users that want to earn fees by minting TCAP tokens and adding liquidity on decentralized exchanges or taking advantage of
            arbitrage opportunities.

        question: "Is TCAP decentralized?",
        answer:
          <div className="answer">
            TCAP uses Developer Keys to pause deposits and minting in case of a bug to protect users, this can only be activated once per vault.
            To change protocol parameters a governance token CTX is used in combination with a Timelock contract.

        question: "How is TCAP pegged to the price of total crypto market cap?",
        answer:
          <div className="answer">
            TCAP uses Chainlink oracles which enables Cryptex to aggregate multiple data points from the top crypto data providers in the world,
            bringing that data on chain using Ethereum smart contracts.

      {
        question: "Why would I mint TCAP over trading it?",
        answer:
          <div className="answer">
            There are various strategies that can be employed when minting TCAP.Traders may use TCAP to speculate longing/ shorting the total crypto market
            cap. Remember when minting TCAP that there is a 150 % minimum collateral ratio to prevent users from getting liquidated.

      {
        question: "Why is the TCAP market price different from the oracle price?",
        answer:
          <div className="answer">
            The Cryptex protocol is able to control the price to which TCAP is minted at, but not for what it sells at on the secondary market.
            The team is currently building Vaults V2 which will help keep TCAP closer to its peg.

      },
      {
        question: "Are there any fees?",
        answer:
          <div className="answer">
            There are no fees for buying, selling, or holding TCAP on the secondary market. There are also no fees for minting new TCAP within the Cryptex protocol,
            however there is a 1% burn fee which goes towards funding future Cryptex DAO activities.

            CTX is an ERC20 token powering the Cryptex protocol.The Cryptex protocol is a DAO specializing in bringing traditional assets to the decentralized world.

      {
        question: "What's the total supply of CTX, and how much is in circulation?",
        answer:
          <div className="answer">
            CTX has a max supply of 10,000,000. Of the max supply, the circulating supply is reduced by:<br /><br />
            <ul>
              <li>The DAO treasury itself, which is controlled by Crypt Keeper delegators.</li>
              <li>The time-locked Founder's Fund.</li>
              <li>Initial Protocol Incentives.</li>
            </ul>
            Furthermore, a maximum 2% supply inflation is hardcoded into the protocol, which, in the case of a black swan event, is available only
            by governance proposals. For more information, please see the detailed breakdown of the circulating supply available on CoinGecko.

            People ask all the time how we got on Gemini; Joe just tells them: Well, I was eating pizza in the west village in 2019, the twins ran by me,
            I chased them 6 blocks and pitched them in the middle of the street. I lost half a slice that day, it was like 95 out and I had to run my
            ass off because those two “jog” like I run. Thankfully the light turned red. They were very polite and cordial. Asked if I had a card,
            I said no I was just eating pizza. They gave me someone on their team to email and it went from there for 2 years.

            The mission of Cryptex is to get TCAP, CTX, and any subsequent launches that we have, into the hands of as many people around the world as we can.
