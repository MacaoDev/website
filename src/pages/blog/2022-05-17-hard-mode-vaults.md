Cryptex “Hard Mode” vaults are now live! Hard mode vaults allow users to mint TCAP with a 110% minimum collateral ratio, allowing for more TCAP to be minted with posted collateral. Here’s how you can use them:

1. To open a Hard Mode vault visit app.cryptex.finance

2. On the app landing page, select “Mint.”
3. Once you see the following screen, make sure the “Hard Mode” vault option is highlighted, choose your collateral, select “Create Vault” and confirm the transaction.

4. On the vault page, you can see your available collateral balance, and the tools needed to mint TCAP. To add collateral to mint TCAP with, enter the desired amount under “Staked Collateral,” press “Add,” and confirm the transaction.

5. Once this transaction is confirmed you can mint TCAP. Enter an amount under “Mint TCAP,” confirm the transaction, and the TCAP will be minted to your wallet!

The vault ratio monitor on the left-hand side displays your collateral ratio and indicates the risk level. It’s up to users to choose their desired collateral ratio level, but be aware that your vault is subject to liquidation once under 110%.

That’s all! You just minted TCAP on hard mode!
