## Introduction

As the cryptocurrency market grows, the range of crypto assets offered is increasing by the day. However, it can be difficult for newcomers to understand the many available types of tokens and assets.

Synthetic assets are one of the latest innovations in the crypto world, and they're changing the game by giving users more options and flexibility. In this post, we'll look at what synthetic assets are, how they work, and what impact they're having on the future of cryptocurrency.

## What is a derivative?

The key to understanding synthetic assets in crypto is first to understand a derivative. A derivative is a product that derives (gets) its price from another asset.

When you buy a derivative, you are predicting that the price of something else will go up or down.

Examples of derivatives in traditional finance are futures contracts, options, and swaps.

Letâ€™s examine one of the first examples of an option.

In the 6th century B.C., Thales the Greek philosopher profited from the olive trade by creating one of the first derivatives.

Here's how it worked.

Thales predicted that there would be a good olive harvest in the next year based on his observations of weather patterns.

He could not afford to purchase an olive press of his own, so instead, he approached the owners of olive presses and negotiated, at a discount, the right to use all the olive presses in the area during the following year. He was not obligated to use them, but he had the right to use them if he wanted. He made the deal in winter, and the press owners saw the deal as a way to obtain some revenue if there was a poor harvest.

Thales reasoned that if the harvest were good next year, there would be high demand to use the presses, and he could rent them out at high rates to make a profit.

If he was wrong, he might not make enough to cover the deposit; however, his risk was limited to the deposit amount.

In other words, Thales created one of the first derivatives, an **option**.

Thales made the right call. The harvest the following year was excellent, which enabled him to charge high rates for using the press and reap a massive profit.

The deposit was a derivative because it derived its value from the underlying asset, the olive press.

## What is a synthetic crypto asset?

Synthetic assets in crypto represent the value of a derivative in a **token**. Again, they are designed to replicate the performance of an underlying asset, but without actually owning the asset itself.

For example, a synthetic crypto asset tied to gold could be used to trade in the gold market without actually owning any.

Let's say that we wanted to create a synthetic crypto asset based on our previous example of Thales and his option in the olive market.

We could call it the OlivePress token, which represents the value of the total olive press market. We obtain data from an oracle that tracks and aggregates olive press market prices.

As there is more demand for olive presses (such as during a robust olive harvest), the token value goes up, and when there is less demand, the token value goes down.

Now, investors in OlivePress can make predictions on the value of the olive press market and go long or short using the synthetic token.

**TCAP by Cryptex Finance** is an example of a synthetic crypto asset. Let's say that you are bullish on crypto, but you want to reduce the risk of owning singular volatile tokens.

Similar to a traditional index fund like VTSAX or the S&P 500, TCAP allows you to gain exposure to the entire crypto market cap without holding each underlying cryptocurrency. This provides you with benefits such as simplified investing and reduced risk, taxes, and cost since you are investing in only one token that covers the entire market.

**Synthetix** is a synthetic asset issuing DeFi protocol. Synthetix creates synthetic derivatives and real-world assets. Some popular assets within the Synthetix ecosystem are synthetic currencies, such as sUSD (US dollar synthetic), the synthetic Euro, and synthetic Yen.

**Mirror** is another synthetic issuing protocol, which provides exposure to real-world assets. Some interesting synthetics within the Mirror ecosystem are their synthetic stock options like mAAPL (synthetic Apple shares), synthetic shares of Airbnb, and other popular stocks.

## What are the advantages of crypto synthetic assets?

One of the main advantages is that synthetic crypto assets can be traded on decentralized exchanges. Crypto synthetic assets offer many additional advantages, including:

* They allow investors to speculate on the future price of a currency or asset without actually owning it directly.
* Almost anything can be tokenized as a synthetic asset in crypto thanks to Cryptex and Chainlink, and several assets can be represented by one token.
* They provide a way to reduce risk and maximize profits through diversification.
* They reduce the costs and tax implications associated with trading multiple separate tokens.

## What are the disadvantages of crypto synthetic assets?

There are some potential drawbacks to synthetic assets in crypto. Synthetic crypto assets don't grant ownership of the tokenized underlying asset, or associated voting rights or dividends. Scaling and fees can also be an issue.

Synthetic tokens rely on oracles, which are instruments that connect data to smart contracts on the blockchain. Since oracles operate using third-party data, there can be risks if that data is inaccurate or compromised. For these reasons, oracles used for synthetic assets must be decentralized and secure.

To mitigate potential risks with synthetic assets, it's critical to ensure that they are fully backed, collateralized, and audited. Using industry-standard decentralized oracles such as Chainlink ensures that the data used in synthetic asset smart contracts are secure, accurate, and reliable.

## Conclusion

The rise of synthetic assets has been a game-changer for the cryptocurrency industry. These assets are paving the way for a new era of crypto investing. Synthetic assets encapsulate many markets within cryptocurrency. Protocols like Synthetix are opening traditional currencies to be traded on the blockchain, and protocols like Mirror are bringing individual stocks on-chain. Innovative solutions such as TCAP reduce barriers for crypto investors and offer stable ways to invest in the entire crypto market, without the risk associated with owning each asset. With Synthetics, the possibilities are endless.
