DeFi's capitalization represents **only 6%** of the total $1.90 trillion crypto market cap.

Decentralized Finance is currently just a small part of the whole Crypto market but is growing each year by onboarding millions of new users interested in DeFi products. Those dozens of millions of blockchain users interacting with classical blockchain protocols like Bitcoin are turning to DeFi to find new ways to earn on their assets.

DeFi is projected to become one of the most important parts of the crypto ecosystem and you'll want to consider replicating its growth in your personal portfolio.

To venture into Crypto is to venture in DeFi, and to believe in DeFi is to believe in the whole of Crypto.
