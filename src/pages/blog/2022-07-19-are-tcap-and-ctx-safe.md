A core component of the financial world is risk management. In spite of this, both 3AC and Celsius seem to have misjudged market risks. With volatility at an all-time high, can Cryptex members feel safe?

$TCAP was created by Cryptex Finance. The token went live in April 2021. $TCAP represents the global crypto market capitalization divided by 10 billions. As a result, the token gains value. $TCAP is an ERC-20 token powered by Ethereum smart contracts. The $TCAP was designed to function like the stable coins, but the metrics on which the $TCAP pegs vary.

### How the protocol protects itself?

1. **A lot of effort is put into making sure there are no bugs:** $TCAP uses **Developer Keys** to pause deposits and minting in case of a bug to protect users, this can only be activated once per vault. To change protocol parameters a governance token $CTX is used in combination with a Timelock contract. the protocol was audited by **Quantstamp**, a top tier auditing firm, to minimize bugs and exploits
2. **Coins are fully backed:** Each $TCAP is collateralized by more than **125%** corresponding amount of $ETH, $DAI, $AAVE or LINK.
3. **$TCAP is pegged to multiple objective sources:** $TCAP uses Chainlink oracles which enables Cryptex to aggregate multiple data points from the top crypto data providers in the world, bringing that data on chain using Ethereum smart contracts.
4. **Thereâ€™s no single decision maker:** The Cryptex protocol is a DAO specializing in bringing traditional assets to the decentralized world. You can vote on DAO proposals with the $CTX token. Maximum 2% supply inflation is hardcoded into the protocol, which, in the case of a black swan event, is available only by governance proposals.
5. **Crypt Keepers / $CTX Holders are the decision makers:**  $CTX hodlers can vote on important issues that affect the $TCAP index, such as what chains the index may be used on, what tokens to add to the treasury vault of the DAO, and even what hodlers can do with their tokens when they aren't being used on votes.
6. **No VCs, no ICO, no IEO involved:** Unlike many other crypto protocols, Cryptex has no VC involved. As a result, the project will be safer, and have a decentralized driven agenda,  since there won't be a profit-driven agenda that will be pushed into the activity.

By keeping safety and growth in mind, the protocol and its' team ensure that the community will not suffer the same consequences as Celsius' users.
