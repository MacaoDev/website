## **About Cryptex Finance**

Cryptex is laser-focused on building innovative, open-source financial products for the global Crypto community. Using Ethereum’s smart contract system, Cryptex is able to build decentralized synthetics such as Total Market Cap Index Token and many more others soon to come. Pairing real-world data supplied on the Ethereum blockchain alongside collateralized backings for generating innovative new tokens, we’re introducing DeFi products that were previously not possible without a centralized custodian or manager. Now, Cryptex Finance is providing the framework for decentralized financial products that offer exposure to more than just BTC, ETH, and other DeFi tokens.
