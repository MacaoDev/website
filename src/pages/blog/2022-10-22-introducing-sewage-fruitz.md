Sewage Fruitz is a collection of 2,500 upgradable NFTs created from the depths of the Ethereum Blockchain and is a reward to all members of the Cryptex Finance community. A fungus, grown out of dark substances in the yard of Mushroom Man as he spreads his spores worldwide.

Holding a Sewage Fruitz PFP unlocks the user's ability to go on quests within the Cryptex Finance ecosystem, completing tasks that will be unlocked inside the DAO. Sewage Fruitz holders can earn upgrades and badges by completing these quests. Users can burn these upgrades in the future based on their achievements and earn CTX, the Cryptex Finance protocol governance token available worldwide on Coinbase, Gemini, Huobi, and many others.

Each Sewage Fruitz will be valued by the number of achievements it unlocks over time. Users can choose to burn and collect the rewards for their achievements, or list their PFP on platforms like Opensea.
