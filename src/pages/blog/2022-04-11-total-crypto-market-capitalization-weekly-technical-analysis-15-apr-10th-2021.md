Hello Everyone,

Welcome to the 15th edition of our weekly series, during which we perform technical analysis on the total crypto market capitalization (TCAP).

To familiarize yourself with the indicators and concepts we discuss here, [please refer to my intro post](https://cryptex.finance/blog/2021-10-09-tcap-technical-analysis-intro-post/), which is a detailed introduction/overview of technical analysis, and the indicators we will be using in these weekly posts. Also, you can find [last week's analysis here.](https://cryptex.finance/blog/2022-03-09-total-crypto-market-capitalization-weekly-technical-analysis-14-mar-8th-2022/)

The information we present here can be utilized for profit using $TCAP, the first synthetic & collateralized asset which encompasses the entire crypto market. Find all the info on $TCAP and how you can use it as a tool for your benefit and as a hedge against your investments in singular assets here - [About Cryptex Finance](https://cryptex.finance/#about)

However, for this analysis, we will be using the TOTAL crypto market chart (Calculated by TradingView). I am using TOTAL since the $TCAP chart has not matured enough to provide a complete picture of the market's history. Later on, as time progresses, we will switch our analysis to the $TCAP chart, as it allows us to make hypothetical investments and apply them to our study.

DISCLAIMER: These articles will represent my thoughts and are in no way intended to be used as a recommendation or as financial advice. This is for educational and research purposes ONLY. I want to re-state that we will be adopting an agnostic/neutral view of the market. We will not be thinking about what we want/wish to happen but instead what we believe will most likely occur.

TA is simply deriving the events that we think have the highest probability of occurring, not predicting the future. Life can always throw us a curveball or two. With that being said, let's get into this week's analysis:

## Daily Chart

![TCAP Daily Chart](/img/ta15-dc.jpeg "TCAP Daily Chart")

**Analysis:** The downtrend has been broken when the price of TCAP put in a higher high than the previous lowest high at $2.1T to reach the 200-Day SMA and broke back down to ~$1.92T. As the price is near the lower end of the Bollinger Bands, I don’t believe it has much more room to move lower. The most likely scenario here looks like it will drop to around $1.83T level, before finding resistance and continuing on to put in a higher high at $2.4T - $2.5T TCAP.

Here is a visual representation of the downtrend along with the 20, 50 & 200 SMA’s added to the chart:

Now we must identify the levels of support & resistance to be able to measure this move as it goes on. I have added resistance/support levels to the chart (some we have been using for months.)

Because the TCAP put in a higher high, we can reasonably expect it to put in a higher low, this is also supported by the fact that the price is near the lower end of the Bollinger Bands, which means it doesn’t have much room to move further down and will most likely bounce off the lower end to go back up to test the top level of these bands. This lower level sits at around $1.83T, while the 50-Day SMA sits at around the $1.8T level. Thus, this is the first area of support for us on this chart. 

* Breaking out upward will see a re-test of the $2.2T resistance, and if passed, we will most likely see a large move up to the $2.4T - $2.5T level. 
* However, if the price significantly breaks under the $1.8T support, we will most likely see another test of the $1.46T level, and will most likely lead to a new low. 

We will now look to the Daily Indicators to see which direction has the higher odds of happening.

### Daily Indicators

![TCAP Daily Indicators](/img/ta15-di.jpeg "TCAP Daily Indicators")

* **MACD:** Continuing bearish cross, but looking to be curling back up. Indicating price could decrease further, but will go up overall.
* **RSI:** Pointing slightly upwards, indicating the price will rise.
* **OBV:** Pointing upwards, indicating the price will rise.
* **MACD Histogram:** Dark red, but seems pretty extended, and doesn’t seem to have much more room to go lower before turning bright red and green going from distribution to accumulation.

## Weekly Chart

![TCAP Weekly Chart](/img/ta15-wc.png "TCAP Weekly Chart")

**Analysis:** TCAP is at a crucial level here. A break under $1.8T could see the whole weekly chart transformed into a big bear flag. However, because the price touched the bottom of the Bollinger Bands, and then bounced and crossed the midpoint of the bands, the chances of the price touching the top of the bands are higher than not. So this leads me to believe the price will bounce at the $1.8T level to go back up and touch the top of the bands at $2.2T level and will most likely break out to the $2.4T-$2.5T level.

![TCAP Weekly Chart 2](/img/ta15-wc2.jpeg "TCAP Weekly Chart 2")

Here, we can see the recent downtrend and overall uptrend lines. Coincidentally the uptrend line is in line with the 50-Day SMA and bottom of the daily Bollinger Bands which leads me to believe that this is going to be hard support. If this support were to hold, there is a very good chance this move becomes an uptrend on its second leg up and we will see if the price can cross the $2.5T level because there is the possibility of a huge head-and-shoulders pattern at this level. 

However, we won’t look too much into the future. For now, it seems very likely that the price will go down to the $1.8T level, and this level seems to be very strong support so this increases the chances of a retest of $2.2T resistance, and because this will be a second re-test, the chances of this resistance being broken is higher than the first time, which leads us to believe that the price is most likely headed to $2.5T.

### Weekly Indicators

![TCAP Weekly Indicators](/img/ta15-wi.jpeg "TCAP Weekly Indicators")

* **MACD:** Continuing the bullish cross, not pointing up as sharply, indicating the next week or beginning of it will likely be more of a consolidation/side-ways move before the continuation upwards.
* **RSI:** Pointing upwards, indicating price will increase.
* **OBV:** Pointing upwards, indicating price will increase.
* **MACD Histogram:** Going from light red to green, indicating a period of accumulation and price increase is coming.

## Monthly Chart

![TCAP Monthly Chart](/img/ta15-mc.jpeg "TCAP Monthly Chart")

**Analysis:** The two levels to look at here are the $2.2T and $1.8T levels. A break over/under these levels will answer the questions of where the price is headed overall for the next few months or more. The Daily & Weekly charts have indicated that the price will, at least for the medium-term, increase. So we can reasonably expect a test of the $2.5T level which could possibly represent a head-and-shoulders bearish pattern.

### Monthly Indicators

![TCAP Monthly Indicators](/img/ta15-mi.jpeg "TCAP Monthly Indicators")

* **MACD:** Continuing bearish cross without seeming to be curling back up as of yet indicating price will continue lower.
* **RSI:** Pointing slightly downwards, indicating price will continue lower.
* **OBV:** Pointing downwards, indicating price will continue lower.
* **MACD Histogram:** Just turning dark red, indicating downwards consolidation, downtrend still has room to go.

**Final Thoughts:** In the short to medium term, we can expect to see a price increase overall from the recent lows. In the long term, nothing is clear yet if this move is significant or just some relief in a multi-year bear market. We can expect the upwards movements to be more of an upwards consolidation than sharp moves up. We will re-assess the situation after the support/resistance lines are tested.
