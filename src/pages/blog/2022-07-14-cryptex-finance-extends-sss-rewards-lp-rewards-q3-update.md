Since October 7th, 2021, Cryptex has incentivized Single-Sided CTX staking with CTX rewards. We are happy to announce that we are extending CTX SSS today, July 13th, 2022 with 12,655 CTX.

It’s important to remember that these rewards are streamed 100% per block for 3 months and contains no lockup. There’s a 7 days minimum staking period.

These rewards are sourced from the team multi-sig, which now contains a balance of 350,000 CTX, with the balance of our treasury (5,170,094 CTX) fully locked up and subject to DAO vote before ever being accessed.

**We’ve also extended the Sushiswap CTX/WETH LP rewards, once again. Here are the technical details:**

Starting July 15th, 2022, 26,038 CTX have been added as rewards for the TCAP/WETH Uniswap V3 liquidity pool. these rewards will stream for 3 months on a per-block basis, with no lockup.

Starting July 27th, 2022, 13,348 CTX have been added as rewards for the TCAP/WETH Sushiswap liquidity pool. these rewards will stream for 3 months on a per-block basis, with no lockup.

**In keeping with our DAO's mission of TCAP and CTX reaching the hands of the world in a fully decentralized manner, the core team will not be operating as Crypt Keepers (protocol delegates) and rewards this task to members of our community. When users stake CTX, they delegate to Crypt Keepers.**

You can find the full list of Crypt Keepers here: [](https://app.cryptex.finance/governance)<https://app.cryptex.finance/governance>

Reminder that:

1. In order to propose a vote, a minimum of 100,000 CTX is required.
2. In order to pass a vote, a minimum of 400,000 CTX is required.

**We stay committed to the community, and continue to grow as much as we can during these turbulent times.**

\- Team Cryptex
