***Q&A from the Community***

**What is the longterm vision of Cryptex?** 

37:39

“What we are trying to do is to build out data that is currently unavailable to the world and make it available to the world in the most decentralized way possible. Ideally, if we can do this correctly I would like to see Cryptex multiple into different segments all throughout DeFi, NFTs, gaming, and art. We have a team here of individuals all throughout the DAO that can fully take these visions and create them into this long-term situation. From an oracle and data perspective, it's limited to one of two things. You have the ability to what is currently being created which is what we learned through our experience with Chainlink with JPEGz, and you have the ability to think it up.

From a long-term perspective, it's a matter of building really cool things and making sure the usage matches that. And then pushing them out into the world, which is the mission of the DAO. Unlike a lot of other projects, Cryptex never held a public ICO, never did a presale, and has no VCs. To this day, everything we are doing we are doing on our own, as decentralized as possible.“ - Joe

**Are there any plans to increase the decentralization of the DAO and core team instead of centralizing it?**  

([01:07:14](https://www.rev.com/tc-editor/edit?token=HYqH6__J7fmVJM3aCsXx9rOSgQawtIXTyokoF3BtmePe6WRcNzbxDHCJ5tLzlEng7TnwqpQ3kpaZecndrc9MX8NVXMo&loadFrom=9&ts=4034.53)):

“Cryptex is quite decentralized. The amount of CTX that the multi-sig,has been lower like every deployment of rounds of liquidity. The community is actually like earning CTX and the team is like reducing the amount that they have control. So right now, the team, or at least the Multisig team doesn't have enough the CTX in order to create or pass a proposal. We need Cryptkeepers to upgrade and change the protocol. I definitely think like we will increase like the amount of keepers, that's going to be something good. If we make efforts on increasing, that will be, I mean, um, on the centralization will be in increasing the, the amount of keepers because that's, we can really decentralize the DAO in a natural way. The good, thing about the Keeper program is, if you are not fine with the keeper and you can move your asset from one keeper to another and you are still like the owner of your token.” - Cris

([01:09:06](https://www.rev.com/tc-editor/edit?token=HYqH6__J7fmVJM3aCsXx9rOSgQawtIXTyokoF3BtmePe6WRcNzbxDHCJ5tLzlEng7TnwqpQ3kpaZecndrc9MX8NVXMo&loadFrom=9&ts=4146.29)):

“When the app is updated and we release that, there will be some enhancements to that delegation page where it's much more flexible for you to change some of your own info, or even, add yourself as a CryptKeeper on there. There's much more flexibility that is coming to that delegation page for sure.” - Matz

**Is the TCAP peg officially fixed and will JPEGz bring up similar concerns?**  

([01:00:53](https://www.rev.com/tc-editor/edit?token=HYqH6__J7fmVJM3aCsXx9rOSgQawtIXTyokoF3BtmePe6WRcNzbxDHCJ5tLzlEng7TnwqpQ3kpaZecndrc9MX8NVXMo&loadFrom=9&ts=3653.02)):

“The peg is still under research. I think it's in these final stages, but it's still not deployed. JPEGz does not have the peg-fix mechanism. What we have done is made sure that the protocol is upgradeable, meaning the JPEGz walls will be upgradeable to the work we do with the peg fix. We've already tested that and so once we have the peg mechanism ready it will be rolling it out for JPEGZ. So to answer your question right now, no, but definitely that's something that will be rolling out as soon as we have a fix.” - Voith

**Will there be a TCAP market listing? Is the product ready for this since we have been so adamant that we want to provide an institutional-grade product to such a large audience?**  

**Why is there a CTX market listing and not one for our other products? The vaults and defi protocol don't necessarily impress me as much as TCAP and JPEGz do.**  

49:16

“When you start out in the beginning, you’re out here chasing people down the street for opportunities. Once those initial opportunities come to you, now you have the ability to reach out to people and network. I can’t say when in regards to when a listing will take place on any exchange, all I am saying is that do not think that is something we are working on. We understand that centralized exchanges present a huge opportunity for the average person to interact with not only the protocol but what the protocol creates. These in most cases are multi-billion dollar entities and they are going to move how they move, now I can annoy them every day (which I do), but they are going to move at their own pace.” - Joe

**Have we implemented CIP-17 yet? That was approved to add rewards for CTX LPs on UNI for the next 3 months.** 

(56:22) 

“UNI swap V3 was extended at the last point until November 16th. With that said, rewards have been active and, and paying out there, it got a little tricky because the keepers, you know, we had a discussion with them on rewards where we decided to suspend sushi for some time, focus exclusively on Uniswap and single sided staking, but to also reduce the amounts that went to Uniswap V3. To my understanding it's done until November 16th. But if Voith or Chris, if any of you would like to elaborate on the CIP 17, feel free to hop in.” - Joe

([57:13](https://www.rev.com/tc-editor/edit?token=HYqH6__J7fmVJM3aCsXx9rOSgQawtIXTyokoF3BtmePe6WRcNzbxDHCJ5tLzlEng7TnwqpQ3kpaZecndrc9MX8NVXMo&loadFrom=9&ts=3433.4)):

“Actually this is for the CTX one. The, TCAP one is on Uniswap V3, the CTX one got canceled on sushi swap, but never got renewed. The vote passed it, but just as we were going to deploy it, some community members were expressing their doubts. Some research were was done on that about the protocol owner incentives and stuff like that. I feel like if anything is not ready right now for implementing, we should just launch a small round on Uniswap V3 in the meantime, so that way, because it is approved, but it wasn't deployed. So maybe like deployed this round for the three months and maybe for the next round launch with the new program. I see that there's like a lot of discussion on that one. Maybe we can provide a new vote.” - Cris

([59:19](https://www.rev.com/tc-editor/edit?token=HYqH6__J7fmVJM3aCsXx9rOSgQawtIXTyokoF3BtmePe6WRcNzbxDHCJ5tLzlEng7TnwqpQ3kpaZecndrc9MX8NVXMo&loadFrom=9&ts=3559.31)):

“Although we have the ability to deploy it on Uniswap v3, I think we heard from out CrypytKeepers that it's not a good time to deploy more CTX rewards. And internally as a team, we also thought about this experiment and we also wanted to see how this would impact the price of CTX. We decided let's observe it for a month and see, we can always deploy more rewards if the price starts tanking, and that's detrimental to the protocol. But so far, what we see is without deploying any rewards, the price hasn't moved much. So this is definitely something we need to keep in mind before deploying more rewards. And as Chris said, let's take a vote on this. But let's keep in mind also like, uh, about this experimented until now. Like the price has not moved even though we have not added more rewards.” - Voith

**CTX volume on Huobi always above 1m, but other exchanges are less, does someone know why? Is there wash trading?**  

51:50

“Of course there is. In trading, there's a spread, which has a maker, a taker, and a mid, right? So if you ever actually analyze the volume on Huobi, it's always at the mid, which means it's two bots trading back and forth to each other. Now, there are several reasons why they may do this. They may do this because it earns incentives or VIP points or different things within the exchange by the volume that they trade.

And that may be a reason why they, they are doing that. I know for a fact it is not anything that we are doing, It is not anything that Wintermute is doing, it is not being done on the Cryptex side of things. It's most likely not being done on a Huobi side of things. It's probably a participant over there who analyzed something that they said, Okay, if we just go back and forth at the mid here, we can facilitate the appearance of volume. That's, that's my thoughts on it. I could be right or wrong, but with that said, those trades are somebody actively, buying and selling or that would affect the action. It's, it's at a midpoint.

So meaning that it's just them going back and forth to, to one another at a zero, net PnL. And, uh, you know, it's, it's unfortunate. CTX is not the only governance asset or any asset that trades on Huboi, no one's immune from that. It's not like I can call Hobi and say, Hey, you know, stop doing this because it's not them doing it. You know what I mean? Like, it's, it's not really something that I could say. But what I can recommend you all is to check out [nomics.com](http://nomics.com), and if you look up certain exchanges, you will see that the data in how they convey their transactions, there's a rating for it. There's an A through F system.

Nothing against Huobi. We love Huobi, and we think that they're a wonderful exchange, but at the end of the day, in terms of the wash trading that's going on there, it's not us. It's not affecting the price has not affected the price up until this point. “ - Joe
