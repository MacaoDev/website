On April 8th of 2021, Cryptex Finance was born. Since the launch of TCAP & CTX we’ve grown a decentralized community with over 30 DAO contributors, have seen CTX get listed on CEX’s like Coinbase, Gemini, and Huobi, and fully decentralized the protocol via governance delegation. We also saw CTX achieve a cumulative trading volume of $472,883,007.80 over the past year between CEX and DEX.

A major milestone for us was introducing single-sided CTX staking, and creating a governance system for our community to delegate their voting power to Crypt-Keepers. Since then we’ve seen twelve community members step up to represent Cryptex and the community.  

Some important governance decisions this past year were expanding our collateral options for minting TCAP, such as adding $LINK and $AAVE. In addition to this, we also rolled out TCAP onto Optimism for #L222. Cryptex has ambitious goals for Layer 2 and TCAP adoption this year, and we’re beyond excited to continue celebrating these milestones with our community. Here’s what some of our Crypt-Keepers have to say about this year for Cryptex:

”The future of the Cryptex is in the hand of the DAO and the community. I am super excited to see more and more participation from the community in governance, marketing, contribution, and all aspects. Cryptex is building a unique synthetic asset to cover the entire crypto market cap, which is gaining popularity among crypto investors. The unique product position, the diversified and engaging community, plus the strong and hardworking team, altogether will push Cryptex to keep growing. As an early and long-term supporter, I have strong faith in the bright future of the Cryptex project.” - Leo Chen

“I’m excited about more people joining the Cryptex DAO in the future. We are a small community but I’m grateful as we have very smart and passionate people involved. It will be amazing to see the DAO expand to hundreds and thousands of people in the future and be a truly decentralized organization. I’m optimistic we can achieve that.” - dnkta.eth

“I'm excited for the DAO and the protocol to continue to grow and thrive in year 2. The project itself has so much promise -- TCAP is perfect for a broad segment of investors that seek exposure to the total crypto market cap and soon it will be joined by even more innovative DeFi products. But I believe it's the people that differentiate good projects from great ones. This is where Cryptex shines. The team is brilliant and openly interacts with the community. DAO contributors and Crypt Keepers bring a variety of backgrounds and skills and are empowered to help shape the future. The broader community is engaged and has such a supportive and welcoming energy. I'm confident that these strong foundations will help the community grow, strengthen, and evolve as the project does. And I have no doubt that we'll all succeed together.” - DesertDwelr

In addition to decentralizing the protocol, the team has been working to innovate TCAP and new products. With our next launch currently underway, here’s what the team has to say about the future of the protocol:

“I'm excited about the new innovations coming from Cryptex this year. Vaults v2 will be a game-changer for TCAP, and our next launch will increase TCAP supply and help improve TCAP adoption” - Preston

“This has been such an incredible year. Between CTX and TCAP, our protocol has seen over 700 million dollars in total transactions. We’ve achieved CTX trading in over 100 counties through our CEX listings and we’re beyond excited for what’s to come for TCAP, CTX and beyond as we continue to put our protocol into the hands of the world.”- Joe  

“I still remember the moment of launch with the team, our hearts were pounding with excitement and we were looking at the monitors like crazy. I can’t wait to launch what we have been working on with the community, make Cryptex more accessible, and feel that excitement again. It feels like not much time has passed but it’s almost 2 years for me. ” - Cris

“We began our journey building community one by one through Reddit and Twitter. Over the past year that has grown into a devoted, organic community that welcomes new users and members from every country in the world. Having this loyal base who believes in the vision of Cryptex, will continue to widen our reach within web3 and traditional channels for years to come.” - Matz

“I can't wait for the day when TCAP will be the de facto benchmark index for comparing crypto funds. I'll be super happy when TCAP gets used by hedging instruments like options for going long or shorting the entire crypto market. I'm also excited about the technical challenges we face around making synthetic assets stick to their peg. I'm hopeful that we'll be innovating in this space and will come up with new and exciting products.” - Voith

“Working on Cryptex has been an amazing experience. I’m thankful to be surrounded by the smartest minds in the Ethereum ecosystem, and for building products that will reshape traditional finance. I’m excited to expand the Cryptex infrastructure with our next launch.” - Brendan
