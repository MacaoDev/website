Cryptex Finance builds innovative, open-source DeFi solutions for the Web3 community and provides real-time exposure with index tokens for the crypto and NFT market. Cryptex created Space Invaders to help people get an inside look into the minds of the most important web3 creators and builders of our time.

On September 13th Cryptex welcomed Aspeneth.eth and Defi Dave, as our hosts. DeFi Dave is the host of his own podcast, known as the flywheelpod, a podcast dedicated to covering the latest developments in the Frax ecosystem and highlighting the most impactful players on-chain.

As well as hosting his own podcast, Dave is an advisor for Pitch money, a Frax Finance Missionary, and also is the co-founder of PIF labs as well as much much more.

In this post, we are sharing the most thought-provoking and alpha-infused pieces of the conversation. These are things most people would not get a chance to find out unless they were listening to the conversation at air time.

Read on for the alpha leaks from Space Invaders Episode 19 with Defi Dave

Aspeneth.eth : You are actually the co-founder of PIF Labs, so of course, you are building during the bear market. Do you believe building during the bear market is one of the best things you can do?

Defi Dave : Yeah, I think that’s the best time you can actually build because there are less distractions. In a bull market, a rising tide lifts all boats, so you could be doing anything with your project and it could rise. What’s healthy about a bear market is it actually filters out all the bad projects, it has a really good filtering mechanism. I like to call it “all projects need to go through a dark time, they always need to go through adversity,” because that’s what really builds character and shows if this project is going to stick around for the long term. Bitcoin has gone through that, Ethereum has gone through that, bear markets are a healthy process. When you have a hype cycle, you attract those who are short-term-minded, and short-term-minded people create short-term results.

Aspeneth.eth : On the recent episode of the flywheel podcast, they spoke about how "America is the single-biggest market being excluded from innovation” which you then quote tweeted and mentioned how you hope our political leaders come together and make the US an oasis for blockchain innovation like it was for the internet here in the 90s/00s. What steps do you believe need to be taken to have this become a reality?

Defi Dave : What I find really interesting about the whole crypto and US regulation versus world regulation is that it’s really ironic. With the internet in China, you basically have the internet kind of blocked off by the Great Wall of China, it’s very controlled. However, the rest of the world’s internet is more free. But in Crypto, the US is blocked off as this regulatory island whilst the rest of the world is more free financially. It’s easier to sign up for exchanges, get into token sales, get airdrops. It’s all under this idea of protecting investors which is obviously important, but this is to the point of guys, you’re literally hurting investors with this. This isn’t the 1930’s.

When it comes to any new technology, it’s always different than the preceding ones before. Television was very different than radio, you can’t regulate it the same way. The internet was very different than television, you can’t regulate it the same way, that’s why they came up with all the rules that they did in the 90’s and 2000’s. From those regulations and laws, it was basically able to foster in Silicon Valley itself. For “Web 2,” the center of it was Silicon Valley, but with DeFi and Web 3, because of the friction that exists with regulatory agencies and congress now, we haven’t been able to do the same here. We still haven’t gotten a clear ruling of what exactly is a security and what isn’t a security, we are just playing guessing games in this gray area.
