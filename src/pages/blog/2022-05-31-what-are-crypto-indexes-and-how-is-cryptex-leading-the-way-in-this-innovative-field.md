In traditional markets, indexes are a way for investors to get exposure to many different types of markets, national economies, and asset classes. Indexes like the Nasdaq100 which tracks American tech stocks or the S&P500 which tracks the 500 largest American companies come to mind when describing those financial products. But indexes are not solely focused on the American economy and investors can also invest in more young and growing economies with the Vanguard Emerging Market ETF or the MSCI World Index.

The latter aims to bring the whole world's traditional markets into an ETF that is easily tradeable and makes for an easy retirement plan.

Like traditional indexes, a crypto index tracks a specific asset class, in that case: cryptocurrencies.

Going beyond just individual investing picks, indexes gives investors the ability to enter an entire market of a respective asset class.

Usually, indexes are listed on stock exchanges, they can only be traded during the week's trading sessions, and have annual managing fees set by the providers.

Many companies seeing the opportunities that the crypto market offers to the world have now started procedures to get crypto indexes released in traditional markets. Still, those, when available, come with the same set of cons that any other index comes with in Wall Street: time constraints in trading hours, prone to regulation, and fixed annual fees. Most importantly those indexes only represent a small basket of the biggest cryptos and tokens available right now thus failing in the promise of capturing the whole crypto market, consequentially leaving much potential growth behind.

This is in this optic that Cryptex launched the first total crypto market cap index: $TCAP.

To capture the momentum of the crypto market, Cryptex developed a decentralized token on the Ethereum blockchain that uses on-chain data to follow the entire capitalization of the crypto market.

The current crypto market valued at over $1.2 trillion is now accessible through $TCAP to traders wanting to take both short and long opportunities in market cycles or investors believing long term in cryptocurrency.

## $TCAP in volatile times

In today's volatile climate some traders may wish to short the market if they believe this downturn is still in the making. While other investors would prefer opening a long position on the crypto market thinking we’ve touched the bottom. 

$TCAP allows for both of these moves. Thanks to its minting and burning mechanism investors can short the market or just buy the token on exchanges to open a classic long position.

Cryptex aims to open a way for a new wave of crypto-focused financial products that lessen the inherent risk of crypto investing: high volatility and portfolio uncertainty.
