Cryptex Finance builds innovative, open-source DeFi solutions for the Web3 community and provides real-time exposure with index tokens for the crypto and NFT market. Cryptex created Space Invaders to help people get an inside look into the minds of the most important web3 creators and builders of our time.

On August 16th Cryptex featured BlockchainBoy as our guest for the 17th episode of Space Invaders. BlockchainBoy is a Crypto Content creator and self-made entrepreneur with over half a million on TikTok. Typically these episodes are recorded live on Twitter Spaces and then published on YouTube and TikTok.

In this post, we are sharing the most thought-provoking and alpha-infused pieces of the conversation. These are things most people would not get a chance to find out unless they were listening to the conversation at air time.

Read on for the alpha leaks from Space Invaders Episode 17 with Crypto Content Creator BlockchainBoy

Aspeneth.eth : Is there anything you are looking forward to in the space right now?

Blockchain Boy : I am looking forward to the Ethereum Merge cause that is either going to determine if I move back in with my parents or if Crypto succeeds. Lord knows, we got a lot riding on that. I do think it's going to be successful and that it is going to really long term impact the price of Ethereum more than I want to say the last two or three Bitcoin halvings, combined for Bitcoin.

I think a lot of investors are realizing the long term potential of Ethereum over Bitcoin, so I think if the merge is successful, we could see a flippening of Ethereum over Bitcoin happen within one or two cycles.  IF Ethereum manges to solve its gas fee issues because that's one of its biggest issues.

Aspeneth.eth : Oh, 100%. It's going to be interesting when the merge does happen because all of this ETH that has been staked is going to be able to be unlocked. I feel like the merge is going to happen, and everyone is going to think it was this crazy moment, when in reality it isn’t really affecting the daily user.

Blockchain Boy : Yeah, I think there is a lot of hype. We will see a sell off, I’m sure and then we will see a longer, maybe year or two later, the implications of the merge really kick into effect.

**ALPHA**

Aspeneth.eth : Is there anything that you think is needed right now in the space?

Blockchain Boy: We need to be able to proactively go out there and talk to legislators. My biggest concern is America crushing innovation like it has been for the last two decades with a view towards doing things such as security offerings and new tech. I think a lot of that is due to our old politicians, but I just really do not want to see innovation being stifled, especially in the blockchain space.

We could be the center of Web 3. New York, California, and Miami are all really pro Web 3. Here in Florida, I have a buddy who is the head of the Florida Blockchain Business Association, a lobbying group that has gotten proactive Blockchain legislation passed at the state level.

If we want to make a DAO for this, I think it's super, super key, we make a DAO for proactive legislation in the blockchain space. I think it's desperately needed, if we let these old politicians regulate us we are going to end up with nothing.

I hope we can get this message along to people and not have people like Elizabeth Warren preaching about investment safety without seeing any of the benefits that crypto provides.

Aspeneth.eth : 100%, you take Elizabeth Warren for example and you have all these things happening in the market such as 3AC, Celsius, etc. She only chooses to look at the bad things, as most politicians do when they speak about crypto. I am just hoping what they chose to regulate doesn’t destroy the market.

Blockchain Boy : Exactly, it's what serves their agenda and if their agenda is to crush DeFi, then they will crush DeFi. I rather see a government who decides to tax it, rather than get rid of it entirely.
