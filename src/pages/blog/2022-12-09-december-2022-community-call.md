“The new contracts for the bridge are being audited by QuantStamp, so not much that we can do right now until the audit is finished. We are going to do a two steps process, the first one is that review the code and provide feedback, then we make updates, and then they make a final review. After that, we will be ready to deploy to mainnet. That's on the audit side, on the Oracle side, we're required to have the Oracle ready on Mainnet, but that's still not ready for Mainnet, so we need to wait in order to deploy JPEGz.

Nothing we can do, just wait and be patient. But while we are doing that, we are upgrading and tweaking some stuff that we have. For example, we are finishing the Sewage Fruitz quests and functionality for the front end. We are doing some revamps on the front end, so it's easier for new users. We have also bridged CTX on Arbitrum because we have some plans related to JPEGz over there and with Sewage Fruitz over there, we want to use CTX over there. We are writing documentation so that way we can use it to encourage new developers and also if we need to do another audit, the information will be easier to find. Finally sETH as collateral, for TCAP, we posted a forum post. This week, we are going to launch off-chain vote using a snapshot, and after that, we are ready to deploy it on Mainnet.” - Cris

“You'll notice some newer emojis and stickers that will be added, along with a cleanup of just the channels themselves, how they're structured, and how we're making announcements. We've also been including some of the great memes that they've been creating in our newsletter. We are continuing to open up more ways for the community to contribute, such as publishing bounties and really opening things up for grants on Dework. We are looking and are truly focused on grants that will be really be impactful on the developer side of things.

We have moved on from creating Space Invaders, and are gonna be focusing more on educational content in the form of written blog posts along with video content. This content will also serve as a way for us to have a better impact on SEO and on Google searches. As well as video content that could help us gain more eyeballs on Twitter, TikTok and also on YouTube. Although we are moving away from Space Invaders itself, we have pivoted to more thought leadership where the team and contributors will be participants on different podcasts or Twitter spaces.

We've also been working on partnerships and integrations. We shared an announcement about JPEGz being launched on Arbitrum which has led us to have some great moments to share some video content and also get the Arbitrum team to be able to support this content on their Twitter. We are exploring some partnerships with Y2K Finance as well for JPEGz and ultimately for TCAP as well.

We had an incredible event, co-hosted with Coinbase Cloud and also Chainlink. We shared some video content from that, that night, if you were there in person, you know, thank you so much for joining us. It was really cool to share more about JPEGz and how we are collaborating with Coinbase Cloud and Chainlink. We do have some more events that we are definitely looking to be a part of come Q1 of next year.” - Matz

“I would definitely expect to see over the next couple of weeks and months here is looking to expand on the partnership with Arbitrum and making some really cool things happen over there. With regards to Arbitrum, we can kind of push for more functionality within the Cryptex ecosystem and more options. That's one of the things that we are going to be, gonna be looking to achieve. We'll have more information on just how we're going to do it as some of these situations we've been discussing getting a little bit more formalized and available to present to the community. I can say right now that the things that we're working on are very different and have never really been tried before. We want to build on these partnerships a little bit more and make some really cool things happen. Getting CTX, JPEGz, TCAP, and everything else that we create into the hands of the world, focusing on this opportunity for over-collateralization and true decentralized finance to really have the upper hand. Those are gonna be the things that we push strongly for always, but even more so around project launches and different things that we're doing.” - Joe
