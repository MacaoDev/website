A Uniswap V3 pool has been opened and incentivized to reduce slippage and increase capital efficiency for LPs. Uniswap V3 allows users to target liquidity ranges for ETH/TCAP helping achieve a tighter oracle price and market price of TCAP, while reducing slippage. Here’s how you can provide liquidity to ETH/TCAP on Uniswap V3 and get rewarded:

1. Go to [app.uniswap.org](http://app.uniswap.org) & click “Pool”

2. Select “New Position”

3. Choose ETH and TCAP, and set your fee tier to 0.3%. On the bottom right, select your liquidity range. This is up to traders/users to set. (Be aware that when ETH/TCAP is not trading in your selected liquidity range, you won’t be earning rewards.) Lastly, set your deposit amounts for ETH and TCAP.

4. Preview the transaction, and confirm adding liquidity. Once this transaction is confirmed, select “Pool” again to view and manage your LP position.

Follow the next set of steps to earn CTX rewards for being an ETH/TCAP LP on Uniswap V3.

5. Visit [app.cryptex.finance](http://app.cryptex.finance) and click the farm icon. Your TCAP/ETH LP will auto-populate under Uniswap V3 Liquidity Rewards and show as status pending. Click on the Approve button to prepare your LP position to get deposited.

6. Then click stake and confirm the transaction. After this transaction is confirmed, you will begin earning rewards! It’s important to note that you need to unstake your LP in order to unlock the current rewards you have earned. Then you can claim them.
