We’re excited to announce that Cryptex Finance — *a multi-network DeFi protocol that provides Web3 users with broad market exposure to the NFT market through a decentralized index token —* has integrated [Chainlink NFT Floor Price Feeds](https://docs.chain.link/data-feeds/nft-floor-price) to help access accurate and reliable NFT floor price data for leading NFT collections. This data is then used within JPEGz, the first NFT market index token tracking the following projects:

### Securing JPEGz With Chainlink NFT Floor Price Feeds

The NFT market has seen extreme success despite its volatility, hitting over [200,000 NFT sales](https://nonfungible.com/market-tracker?days=9007199254740991) at its peak. And it’s only getting bigger. With growing adoption from global brands and strong communities bolstering the longevity of top NFT collections, there was a clear need for an NFT market index token. JPEGz is that token.

We chose Chainlink as our go-to oracle solution due to its main benefits, including:

* **High-Quality Data** — Chainlink Price Feeds source data from numerous premium data aggregators, leading to price data that’s aggregated from hundreds of exchanges, weighted by volume, and cleaned from outliers and suspicious volumes. Chainlink’s data aggregation model generates more precise global market prices that are resistant to API downtime, flash crash outliers, and data manipulation attacks like flash loans.
* **Secure Node Operators** — Chainlink Price Feeds are secured by independent, Sybil-resistant oracle nodes run by leading blockchain DevOps teams, data providers, and traditional enterprises with a strong track record for reliability, even during high gas prices and extreme network congestion.
* **Decentralized Network** — Chainlink Price Feeds are decentralized at the data source, oracle node, and oracle network levels, generating strong protections against downtime and tampering by the data provider or the oracle network.
* **Transparency** — Chainlink provides a robust reputation framework and set of on-chain monitoring tools that allow users to independently verify the historical performance of node operators and oracle networks, as well as check the real-time prices being offered.

Additionally, our first integration with Chainlink oracle services was with TCAP, a cutting-edge index token for the total crypto market cap, and we used Chainlink Price Feeds — the industry standard for digital asset market data — to help underpin TCAP. Using Chainlink NFT Floor Price Feeds for JPEGz felt natural, given Chainlink’s past history of proven reliability and security.

*“Cryptex is thrilled to announce the creation of JPEGz, a fully collateralized, data-backed index token providing market cap exposure to the NFT sector. The robust calculation and secure delivery of NFT floor price data by Coinbase Cloud and Chainlink helps support the growth of this unique asset class .”*
