Today, 11/18, TCAP rewards have been extended. 10,000 CTX have been added to the TCAP Uniswap v3 pool for the next 3 months.

This extension comes from the core contributor multi-sig earmarked since protocol inception for such rewards and NOT from the Cryptex DAO treasury, which remains locked and only accessible via passing of on-chain proposals voted by the community and its protocol delegates.

Today's renewal marks a total of 701,038 CTX governance tokens rewarded to TCAP liquidity providers since inception of the Cryptex Protocol in April of 2021. 

Thank you. 

CRYPTEX IS A FAIR LAUNCH PROTOCOL CRYPTEX IS A DECENTRALIZED AUTONOMOUS ORGANIZATION (DAO). CTX GOVERNANCE TOKENS ARE REWARDED TO SYSTEM KEEPERS AT A VALUE OF $0. NO ICO. NO PRE MINT, MINE OR SALE. NO PUBLIC INVESTORS WERE SOLICITED FOR THE CREATION OF THE CRYPTEX PROTOCOL. NO VC MONEY. VERIFY, DON'T TRUST. ALWAYS DO YOUR OWN RESEARCH. NOT FINANCIAL ADVICE.
